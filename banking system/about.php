      <p>Banks are mainly linked to depositing and lending money. In Indian society,<br> moneylenders used to give money to people in ancient times. They charged a high rate <br>of interest to people as there were no banks or banking systems available at that time.<br> But, with the change in time, the banking system was introduced in India. <br>Now, we have public sector banks and private banks.</p>
